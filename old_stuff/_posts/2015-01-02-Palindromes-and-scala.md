<blink><H1>WARNING!!! PROJECT EULER SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!</H1></blink>
Apparently, in my attempts to learn scala I decided I was going to write some code to find palindromes. This was most likely due to my saying I was going to do project euler problems. So this is what I came up with for the largest palindromes for 3 digit numbers. Of course, I don't know how to run it except in a repl. This probably has no use to anyone either.

If you want to try it, copy and paste all of that code in a scala repl and run something like " palindromicNumberLessThanXTimesY(999,999)". Then you'll be in palindromic number happiness.
