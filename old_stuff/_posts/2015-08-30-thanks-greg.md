So thanks to BIT (Blacks In Technology) and Greg Thompson Jr. I decided to start this project up again. This project
being musing about some of everything and maybe dropping my two cents on public topics of interesting.

Man, I should probably make this dude fix the layout of this blog because apparently I am super awful at this stuff.
At any rate, I hope to write more, contribute more, and well, link to the gists I previously complained about.

That way, they can still count for activity and we will be all the wiser.
