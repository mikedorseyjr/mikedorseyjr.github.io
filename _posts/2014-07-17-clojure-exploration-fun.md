So some time ago (can't believe it's been almost a year) I was working through the book "Clojure for the Brave and True". It's an amazing book and I think that if you're interested in learning Clojure, you should give it a run. Side note, the emacs intro is amazing.

At any rate, my friend <a href="https://github.com/jamalburgess" target="_blank">Jamal</a> was musing about a few difficulties he had with the book. To help him out, I went ahead and published whatever chapter this vampiric stuff was about. I'll share this with you.
