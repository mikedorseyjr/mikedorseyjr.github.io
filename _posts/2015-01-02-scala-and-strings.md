<blink><H1>WARNING!!! PROJECT EULER SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!</H1></blink>

So apparently the day after new years I didn't have anything to do, so I published gists
for <a href="https://github.com/jamalburgess" target="_blank">Jamal</a> of Project Euler
problems I solved that day. Kinda weird but I must have made some temporary new years resolution that failed miserably after 1-02 or something like that. At any rate, this thing finds the max product of string groups. You should run it just like the previous post because it still seems that I didn't know scala at the time.
