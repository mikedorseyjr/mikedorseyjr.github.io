I have no idea how to override, this blog. I give up. If I remember correctly, I can just write some markdown in this posts folder with a date, and not even make a commit. If so, I'll just keep the old layout and let the public see my 3 year long drought of false starts and stops. The commit history for this blog is going to be interesting.

I didn't even get to render it before showtime because I don't want to run another server.
