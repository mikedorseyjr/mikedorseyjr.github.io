# Mike Dorsey Jr's thoughts about stuff

Some time ago I had something up here that used jekyll bootstrap, had all of these funny things about it, and some stuff I didn't want to keep up with. Which is why after 5 blog posts it got abandoned.

There are probably a number of blogging frameworks that are super interesting out there that are capable of even overriding the default github view of projects.

I don't know what those are and I think I just want to make commits with dates, tags, and have those look like medium. Without me having to install a bunch of fanciness I'm not going to read the documentation on.
